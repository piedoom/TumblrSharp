# NewTumblrSharp Documentation

Welcome to the TumblrSharp documentation!  To get you started, here's a few FAQs.  If you need more in-detail documentation,
click some tops on the menu.

## Can I use NewTumblrSharp?

Yes!  
* Everything here is a PCL, so it should work with anything from Windows RT to Silverlight to Desktop.
* This package supports .NetStandard from version 1.3 to 2.0 and supports platform independent development.

## Something isn't working as specified in the documentation!

This repository will always be up-to-date, and it sometimes might fall out of sync with the NuGet servers.
If you need a feature right away, it's best to clone this repository instead of using NuGet.  For more information, check out
