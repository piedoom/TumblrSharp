# NewTumblrSharp

This is a continuation of the excellent [TumblrSharp](https://tumblrsharp.codeplex.com/) C# Library developed by [the community](http://archive.is/mrzqG).

TumblrSharp is a very nicely designed library, and perhaps the *only* usable C# library that currently exists.
However, development for the Codeplex project stopped in 2014.  While using the library, I've noticed several
bugs which I'll fix and post to this repository.
